    "An AI agent is an intelligent system that recieves a high-level goal from a user, and autonomously plans, decides, and executes a sequence of actions by using external tools, APIs, or knowledgeable sources - all while maintaining context, reasoning over multiple steps, adapting to new information, and optimizing for the intended outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristcs of an AI agent are:\n",
    " - **Goal Driven** : You tell agent what you want , not how to do it\n",
    " - **Autonomous planning** - Agent breaks down the problem and sequences task on its own\n",
    " - **Tool Using** - Agants calls APIs, calculators, search tools, etc.\n",
    " - **Context-Aware** - Maintains memory across steps to inform future actions\n",
    " - **Adaptive** - Rethinks plan when things change (e.g. API fails, no data)"
